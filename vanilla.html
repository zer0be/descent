                    attack deals full damage to each of the
                    affected heroes.
                    Either Aurim or Sahla may dodge this

                    upwards, passing through Aurim, Eliam,
                    and a rubble obstacle. (Remember, leap
                    attacks ignore obstacles.) The ape may
                    then make an attack that affects both
                    Aurim and Eliam. The attack deals full
                    damage to each of the affected heroes.
                    Again, either Aurim or Eliam could
