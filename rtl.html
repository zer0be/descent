                    attack deals full damage to each of the

                    Either Aurim or Sahla may dodge this

                    and a rubble obstacle. (Remember, leap
                    attacks ignore obstacles.) The ape may
                    then make an attack that affects both
                    Aurim and Eliam. The attack deals full
                    damage to each of the affected heroes.

          (ignoring armor) for each rank of Aura possessed. Aura inflicts<br />

          dice roll a blank, it is treated as though the figure had rolled a<br />

          In addition, any enemy figure that deals the killing blow to a<br />

          ability. However, a space is only affected by the attack if it has<br />
          line of sight to the target space (ignoring figures for this<br />
          purpose). Blast attacks cannot pass through walls, closed doors,<br />
          or blocking obstacles. The Blast attack deals its full damage to<br />
          each figure affected by it (friendly and enemy). If a Blast attack<br />
          is dodged by more than one figure, only one re-roll may be made<br />

          numerous small wounds. After applying any wounds from that<br />

          of the attacking figure, and all figures underneath the template<br />
          (friendly and enemy) are affected by the attack. A Bolt attack<br />
          only misses on a miss result, and ignores rolled range. Bolt<br />
          attacks cannot pass through walls or closed doors. If it does not<br />
          miss, a Bolt attack deals its full damage to each figure affected<br />
          by it (friendly and enemy). If a Bolt attack is dodged by more<br />
          than one figure, only one re-roll may be made (the first dodging<br />

          against one side of the attacking figure, and all figures<br />
          underneath the template (friendly and enemy) are affected by the<br />
          attack. A Breath attack only misses on a miss result, and ignores<br />
          rolled range. Breath attacks cannot pass through walls or closed<br />
          doors. If it does not miss, the Breath attack deals its full damage<br />
          to each figure affected by it (friendly and enemy). If a Breath<br />
          attack is dodged by more than one figure, only one re-roll may<br />

          inflicts at least 1 damage on the target (before applying armor),<br />
          the target catches fire. After applying any wounds that result<br />
          from the attack, place a burn token next to the affected figure.<br />

          (including itself, and ignoring line of sight) for each rank in<br />

          ability, the attacker must spend one power surge for every rank<br />
          of Fear that figure possesses. If the attacker cannot spend<br />
          enough surges to overcome the Fear ability, the attack automatically misses. Surges spent to overcome this ability<br />

          cannot end their movement in a space containing another figure,<br />
          or an obstacle that blocks movement. A flying figure may end its<br />
          turn in a space containing an obstacle that inflicts damage<br />
          without effect.<br />
          All monsters with the Flying ability automatically have the Soar<br />

          covered in a thin sheet of ice, weakening his items. After<br />
          applying wounds from that attack, place a frost token next to the<br />

          immediately move each affected target figure up to three spaces<br />
          away from its current location. This is reduced by one space of<br />
          movement for each space the target occupies beyond the first.<br />
          The figures must be moved to spaces that do not contain other<br />
          figures or obstacles that block movement. The figure does not actually move through the intervening spaces. As such,<br />
          Knockback movement is not blocked by intervening figures or<br />
          obstacles (though a figure cannot be moved through a closed<br />
          door or wall).</div>

          the figure moves in a straight (i.e., not diagonal) line up to twice<br />
          its remaining movement, ignoring obstacles and enemy figures.<br />
          This portion of the figure’s movement cannot pass through walls<br />
          or closed doors, and must end on an empty space. The figure<br />
          may then make one attack roll against all enemy figures in the<br />
          spaces it just moved through. A leap attack ignores rolled range,<br />
          only missing on a miss result. If the attack does not miss, it deals<br />
          full damage to each figure affected by it. If a leap attack is<br />
          dodged by more than one figure, only one re-roll may be made<br />
          (the first dodging player to the attacking player’s left decides<br />
          which dice, if any, are to be re-rolled). A figure is limited to one<br />

          he may choose to animate the monster. The monster stays on the<br />
          board and is returned to full health, but falls under the control of<br />
          the hero. A hero cannot control more than one monster at a time,<br />

          However, after the monster completes its activation, the<br />
          controlling hero must roll one power die. If he rolls anything<br />

          of his turns, the hero must roll one black power die for each frost
          token on him. For each power surge rolled, one frost token is
          discarded. Otherwise, the tokens remain. Each time a hero

          (treated as 0). A figure that suffers at least 1 wound discards all
          sleeping tokens. At the start of that figure’s turn, its owner may

          that figure’s next turn (or the next time the overlord activates the
          figure, in the case of monsters), one stun token is discarded. If
          the figure was a normal, unnamed monster, its action
          immediately ends – it can do nothing else until the overlord’s
          next turn. If it was a master monster, it may either attack or
          move up to its speed this turn. If it was a named monster, it is
          unaffected by the stun token. Finally, if it was a hero, the hero
          does not receive a full action that turn. Instead, the hero may
          only either move a number of spaces up to his speed, or make
          one attack, or place one order. A stunned hero cannot use any
          ability that requires advancing, running, battling, or readying
          (except for placing a hero order). A figure may have several stun
          tokens on it at once. Since only one stun token is removed each
          turn, such figures remain stunned for multiple rounds.</div>

            For one movement point, a figure in a staircase
            space can move to the matching staircase space as though it
            were adjacent. Attacks may be made across matching staircase
            spaces as though the two ends were adjacent. A figure on a
            staircase has a line of sight to the other side of the staircase and
            all spaces adjacent to it. A figure adjacent to a staircase has line
            of sight to the other side of the staircase.</p>

            attack, perform movement actions other than moving through
            glyphs, or carry items. Villagers move up to four spaces a turn,
            moving after all of the heroes have moved, and are controlled
